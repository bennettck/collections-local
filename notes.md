-- These are notes for Chris, do not delete.

Tomorrow:
Consolidate vibes (emotions seems ok)?
Create golden set for retrevial
Run base line analysis for llms and retrevial

The Langchain retreival methods support tracking of tokens used and the cost. However it looks like the methods in the code are not reporting this info. See TraceID: 019b4d0e-496d-7d52-b0d0-1fd3a5559bde. An example where the tokens and cost are reported correctly is Agentic Search, see traceID - 019b4d0e-49db-7d92-b932-252c65b8fc25

Please update the retrievers to report tokens and cost.
